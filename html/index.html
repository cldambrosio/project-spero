        <h1>ABOUT PROJECT SPERO</h1>
        <p>Allied World Healthcare's core mission is to get healthcare services to underserved communities that need support. This could be because they are isolated or rural, poor, or the healthcare area itself is underserved with limited resources.</p>
        <p>As part of its initiative, Allied World Healthcare worked to spearhead and turn into reality Project Spero that aims to help anyone get information and support for a range of mental health conditions. Key to this is digital health technology, and through a series of 'trigger questions', this will signpost people to the right clinician/institution that</p> can help them with their condition, as well as a range of information tailored to their needs. The project aims to empower community members to seek help for their mental health anonymously, but also start tackle the stigma about a prevalent issue with limited support options.
        <p>This project is being made possible with the help of volunteers who have had some experience with mental health conditions and now want to help others. Allied World Healthcare is building a community of technology and business professionals all focused on supporting their fellow citizens.</p>
